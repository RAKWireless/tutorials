# Getting Started with RUI and WisBlock - LoRa P2P Communication

## Introduction

This repository includes a simple tutorial for test RUI with WisBlock.
The objective is to learn about RUI3 the new RAKwireless tool, to make hardware programming easier. 

## Used Materials

[WisBlock Core RAK4631](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4631-lpwan-node) (x2 Optional)

[WisBlock Base RAK5005-0](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5005-o-base-board) (x2 Optional)

[WisBlock Base RAK1901](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak1901-shtc3-temperature-humidity-sensor)

Or you can purchase together in:

## Contents 

This code is useful to communicate two WisBlock using LoRa P2P and RUI3. There are two files, the first for the WisBlock transmitter and the other for receiving and printing data. The reading of a temperature and humidity sensor is performed. You can refer to the official Hackster tutorial (to be uploaded) for more information.

## How to use

- Download the folder as a zip file or clone as `$git clone https://github.com/RAKWireless/tutorials/RUI3_Basics`
- Open the code in Arduino IDE
- Install the libraries for RAKwireless showed in this [tutorial](https://www.hackster.io/alveiroRakwireless/)
- Run and Upload the code.
